                    <h3>Problem:</h3>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Let us start with explaining you in brief the business problem in Indian
                    Media Industry that we intend to tackle. There are majorly 4 stakeholders
                    viz. Advertisers, Media Agencies, Broadcasters and Broadcast Audience
                    Research Council (BARC) – central rating agency.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Advertisers hire Media Agencies to make an optimized media plan for
                    TV/Digital/Print/Radio. In our case we will be focused only on TV which
                    alone contributes to 44% of overall Media Industry (“A billion screens of
                    opportunity” a report by FICCI-EY 2019). During campaign planning phase,
                    many media agencies rely on cognitive bias rather than on data. The reason
                    being, viewership data is made available post-airing so there is no way of
                    knowing the content performance before the actual airing.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Using advanced Machine Learning algorithms, we try to determine this
                    performance well in advance which helps the agencies take better planning
                    decisions.To read more in detail on this, please refer to our previous
                    blog: <a href="https://www.venanalytics.io/blog/india-media-industry-its-problems-and-scope-for-ai">India Media Industry, its problems and scope for AI</a>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    In India Cricket is not just a sport it’s a sentiment that unites the
                    nation, which means a lot of TV viewership and naturally this gives
                    opportunity to a lot of advertisers and agencies. Keeping this in mind we
                    took it upon us to make sure that these advertisers/agencies take the most
                    informed decision for ICC World Cup 2019.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    <h3>Solution:</h3>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    There are two deliverables that we offered:
                </p>
                <ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li dir="ltr">Dashboard</li>
                    <li dir="ltr">Report</li>
                </ol>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Dashboard helps the user derive his own conclusions from the data. The data
                    is visualized in such a way the it becomes most hassle-free to communicate
                    their own data story. Dashboard helps the user get a perspective on various
                    factors that affect the viewership of a match. These factors can be
                    classified into two broad categories:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li dir="ltr">Known Factors</li>
                    <li dir="ltr">Unknown Factors</li>
                </ul>
                </br>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Know factors are those that are more factual than derived. Factors like
                    time of the match, day of the week, venue etc.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Unknown factors are those that are derived form our understanding of the
                    data, like match dynamics. These are the tricky ones.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    The second part of the deliverable is the report. This is basically a
                    platter of insights put together with a sole purpose of call to action.
                    Let’s go through some of the interesting findings and how these affect our
                    goal of projecting match-by-match viewership of World Cup 2019.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    ICC T20 World Cup 2016 alone accounted to 13% of the total cricket
                    viewership since October 2015, which means that Cricket World Cup is the
                    biggest viewed sports event in India. T20 format garners 1.4x viewership
                    that ODI of Test. Matches were India is playing garner 15x viewership than
                    the matches where India is not playing. Also, matches in India garner 5x
                    viewership that those happening outside India. Of course, there are other
                    elements at play but if we are just looking at these numbers in isolation,
                    we understand that had the world cup been in India it would have rated
                    higher that in England.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Factors like telecast channel, hour of the day and day of the week are
                    amongst the important “known factors” in determining the final viewership.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    We observed that there is a stark co-relation between the TV viewership
                    numbers and Google Trends data.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">

                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    For Google Trends we took into account the Team Name searches in India. We
                    see that there is a spike in the search for Indian National Cricket Team
                    and Pakistan National Cricket Team during ICC Champions Trophy Match 4. The
                    highest spike in terms of viewership and google tends.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    The other and a more important parameter in determining the viewership is
                    the match dynamics. In order to estimate the match dynamics, we first need
                    to get a good hang of the team composition and performance. To understand
                    this, we plotted the individual player performances on 3 scatter plots viz.
                    Batting Matrix, Bowling Matrix and Allrounder Matrix.

                    can be attributed to the underperformance of Hardik Pandya, Vijay Shankar

                    These matrices reveal some interesting insights. Australia is the most
                    likely teams to win the world cup, however England is also just right there
                    with an added home advantage. India, New Zealand, South Africa and
                    Afghanistan are Bowling heavy teams while Pakistan is a more Batting heavy
                    team. Amongst the tail enders are Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and West Indies.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    The purpose of doing this was to understand the kind of clashes that we can
                    expect between two teams. For example, it is likely that clashes between
                    the teams in Q3 of first matrix are likely to be low target matches.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Since we know that batting attracts more viewership than bowling, we can
                    assume that these matches would have relatively low viewership as oppose to
                    matches between Australia, England or Pakistan. Based on this we make some
                    corrections in our projections.

                    <h5>Data Extraction/Scraping:</h5>
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Cricbuzz was our main source of data. But collecting data manually was impossible so we wrote a scraper in Python.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Finding the links for every tournament was a difficult task as cricbuzz uses slugs instead of integer identifier which we could have used by simply incrementing the number in url.</br>
                    So we decided to take help of google ;) </br>
                    Google search request has URL something like this <em>https://www.google.co.in/search?q="your search query"</em></br>
                    So, We made a list of tournaments that we want to find the matches of and then used the above query technique to programatically get the links for listing pages on cricbuzz.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Once we have found the listing page of matches next challenge was to find the links to details page of each match from the list and also detect type of the match.
                    Finding the match type(T20, ODI, Test) has few catches as cricbuzz uses angular ng tags it's not easy to scrape using css query so we used to find ng attrubutes and then the regex match was used to find the type of the match
                </p>
                <p>
                    After we found the type of the match we wrote 3 different scrapers for 3 types of matches. And then all the data was pushed into a CSV/JSON
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Once we have the data in CSV/JSON we can apply our model
                </p>

                <p dir="ltr">
                    For this we extracted 5 years of Google trends data for all the teams.
                    Google trends gives us relative data for the keyword with 100 as the
                    maximum searches in that time span. Also, it allows us to compare and
                    extract only 5 keywords data at a time. Therefore, to extract data for all
                    the teams we had to take multiple extractions with first 4 searches kept
                    constant and only changing the last team name. With date as the key field
                    we combined this data with our original viewership data sheet.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    If we are taking an extraction of over a stretch of 5 years, we don’t get
                    day by day data, but data aggregated over a week. Even then this data
                    resonates quite perfectly with the viewership trends as we will see later.

                    Before putting everything into the model, there was a lot of
                    data-preprocessing that had to be done. A combination of Pandas and MS
                    Excel was used to do so. We chose a combined approach as some things were
                    just easier to do in Excel while others using Pandas.
                </p>
                <p dir="ltr">
                    Firstly, we created a joint excel sheet comprising data from all three data
                    bases, viz Cricbuzz, BARC and Google trends; Cricket_final.xlsx. This was
                    followed by adding some features either using excel or Pandas.

                    be a low run rate and hence a low target match and hence a less popular
                    match. However, matches between batting heavy teams like teams generally
                    garnered higher viewership. Keeping this in mind final predictions were
